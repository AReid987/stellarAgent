- "STG guidance which is again another technique for latent image or latent data guidance."
- "This workflow is basically like the video-to-video workflow that we've experimented with a lot before."
- "The output video is going to perform better than if you just randomly pick one image."
- "The LTX update of the AI models is also using the STG method."
- "LTX video should be a good video model for local AI running."
- "The guy has very consistent style, the backpack looks dirty and all the mud and dust there looks pretty good."
- "The fires are very coherent and the styles of the branches, the road here is very consistent."
- "The output is amazing as you see you're editing the guy walking with the same motions."
- "The backpack, the outfit of the character as well is changed because I have the image for the reference."
- "The river right in the middle the person looks like is walking across the river."
- "The model files on their hugging face page just go to the light Trix LTX video model page."
- "The main purpose of this video is we're going to see the zero 9.1 version of LTX video."
- "The one that enabled STG is doing better even in a small low resolution size."
- "The model is using the STG method and I pretty much like it."
- "The motion of the output video from here you see the fires are very coherent."
- "The styles of the branches, the road here is very consistent on every image frame."
- "The output video is going to perform better than if you just randomly pick one image."
- "The guy has very consistent style, the backpack looks dirty and all the mud and dust there looks pretty good."
- "The output is amazing as you see you're editing the guy walking with the same motions."
