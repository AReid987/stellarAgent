### Objectives
- Understand the limitations of large language models' general knowledge.
- Learn about retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for enhancing LLM knowledge.
- Discover Crawl for AI, an open-source web crawling framework for efficient web scraping.
- Implement Crawl for AI to scrape websites and convert HTML to markdown for LLMs.
- Use sitemap.xml for efficient URL extraction and parallel processing for faster scraping.
- Showcase a RAG AI agent built using Crawl for AI for expert knowledge in a specific framework.

### Instructions
1. **Identify the Problem**:
   - Recognize that LLMs have limited and general knowledge, especially for new topics.

2. **Introduce RAG**:
   - Understand RAG as a method to augment LLMs with external, curated knowledge.

3. **Discover Crawl for AI**:
   - Learn about Crawl for AI, an open-source web crawling framework.
   - Visit the Crawl for AI GitHub page for more information.

4. **Install Crawl for AI**:
   - Use PIP to install the Crawl for AI Python package.
   - Run the setup command to install Playwright under the hood.

5. **Basic Usage of Crawl for AI**:
   - Write a simple script to scrape a single webpage and convert HTML to markdown.
   - Test the script to see the markdown output in the terminal.

6. **Extract URLs Using Sitemap**:
   - Understand the importance of sitemap.xml for efficient URL extraction.
   - Write a custom function to pull the sitemap and extract URLs using XML processing.

7. **Sequential Crawling**:
   - Use the same browser session to crawl multiple URLs sequentially.
   - Run the script to see the length and success status of each crawled URL.

8. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Implement parallel processing to visit multiple pages simultaneously.
   - Set a batch size (e.g., 10) to control the number of parallel sessions.
   - Run the script to observe memory efficiency and speed.

9. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - Check the robots.txt file of websites to understand their scraping policies.
   - Ensure ethical web scraping by respecting the website's rules.

10. **Showcase RAG AI Agent**:
    - Demonstrate a RAG AI agent built using Crawl for AI for expert knowledge in Pantic AI.
    - Provide a GitHub repository link with the agent's code and instructions.
    - Show examples of queries and the agent's responses.

11. **Future Steps**:
    - Mention upcoming videos on building the RAG AI agent and other advanced topics.
    - Encourage viewers to like, subscribe, and stay tuned for more content.
