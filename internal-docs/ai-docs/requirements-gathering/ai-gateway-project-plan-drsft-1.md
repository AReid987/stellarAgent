# Project Overview: Unified AI API Gateway
## Executive Summary
The Unified AI API Gateway project aims to create a single endpoint on a FastAPI server that provides seamless access to a variety of Large Language Model (LLM) inference providers. This gateway will enhance AI model utilization by incorporating features such as caching, automatic retries, fallbacks, prompt optimization, load balancing, intelligent model routing, monitoring, logging, and observability. By leveraging NeoApps.AI, the project will streamline development, reduce costs, and ensure scalability.
