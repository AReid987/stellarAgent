# Plan for AI Gateway with Textual User Interface (TUI)

## Introduction

This document outlines a plan for developing an AI Gateway with a Textual User Interface (TUI). This gateway will provide a unified interface for interacting with various AI models and services, incorporating features like caching, load balancing, and intelligent routing. The TUI will offer a user-friendly way to manage and monitor the gateway.

## Goals

*   Provide a unified API for accessing multiple AI models.
*   Implement a TUI for easy management and monitoring.
*   Incorporate features for reliability and performance, such as caching, load balancing, and automatic retries.
*   Enable prompt optimization and intelligent model routing.
*   Ensure observability of the gateway's operations.

## Architecture

The AI Gateway will consist of the following components:

*   **TUI:** Built using the Textual library, providing an interactive command-line interface for users.
*   **API Gateway:**  Handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate AI models.
*   **Caching Layer:**  Stores responses to frequently accessed prompts to reduce latency and cost.
*   **Load Balancer:** Distributes traffic across multiple instances of AI models or gateway components.
*   **Fallback Mechanism:**  Provides alternative models or services in case of failures.
*   **Retry Mechanism:** Automatically retries failed requests.
*   **Prompt Optimization Module:**  Allows for experimentation and optimization of prompts.
*   **Intelligent Model Routing:**  Directs requests to the most suitable model based on factors like cost, performance, and context.
*   **Observability Tools:**  Provides metrics, logs, and tracing for monitoring the gateway's health and performance.

## Key Features

*   **Unified AI API:** A single endpoint for accessing different AI models, simplifying integration for client applications.
*   **Textual User Interface (TUI):** An interactive command-line interface for managing the gateway, viewing logs, and configuring settings.
*   **Caching:**  Improves performance and reduces costs by storing and reusing responses to common prompts.
*   **Load Balancing:** Ensures high availability and optimal resource utilization by distributing traffic.
*   **Fallbacks:**  Enhances reliability by automatically switching to alternative models or services when primary ones are unavailable.
*   **Automatic Retries:**  Improves resilience by automatically retrying failed requests.
*   **Prompt Optimization:**  Tools and features to experiment with and optimize prompts for better results and cost efficiency.
*   **Intelligent Model Routing:**  Dynamically routes requests to the most appropriate AI model based on predefined rules or real-time analysis.
*   **Observability:**  Comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities to track the gateway's performance and identify potential issues.

## Technology Stack

*   **TUI Framework:** Textual
*   **API Gateway:**  (e.g., FastAPI, Flask)
*   **AI Model Integration:** Portkey
*   **Prompt Management & Evaluation:** Promptfoo
*   **Observability:** Opik
*   **Caching:** (e.g., Redis, Memcached)
*   **Load Balancer:** (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy)
*   **Programming Language:** Python

## Implementation Details

1. **Set up the basic API Gateway framework.**
2. **Integrate with Portkey** to manage connections to various AI models.
3. **Develop the TUI using Textual** for user interaction and management.
4. **Implement caching mechanisms** to store and retrieve responses.
5. **Configure load balancing** to distribute traffic effectively.
6. **Implement fallback strategies** for handling model unavailability.
7. **Develop automatic retry logic** for failed requests.
8. **Integrate Promptfoo** for prompt optimization and testing.
9. **Implement intelligent model routing** based on defined criteria.
10. **Integrate with Opik** for monitoring, logging, and tracing.

## Future Considerations

*   **User Authentication and Authorization:** Secure access to the AI Gateway.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Protect against abuse and ensure fair usage.
*   **Advanced Prompt Engineering Features:** More sophisticated tools for prompt creation and management.
*   **Support for more AI models and services.**
*   **Plugin architecture:** Allow for extending the gateway's functionality.
