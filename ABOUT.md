## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name="problem-statement"></a>

Creating custom assets for the Stellar Blockchain, listing them in the marketplace, and managing wallets is a complex and time-consuming process. Additionally, understanding the data that influences the success of these assets can be challenging.


The need for an **Agent Team** arises to handle tasks such as data analysis, marketing, and asset creation, allowing human designers to focus on creativity and strategy.

=======================================

## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name="idea--solution"></a>

StellarAgent is an innovative platform designed to streamline the creation and management of assets on the Stellar Blockchain. It leverages a team of AI-powered agents to provide comprehensive support across key areas:

- **Data Analysis**: Gain actionable insights through advanced on-chain metrics, sentiment analysis, and other critical data points.
- **Marketing Strategy**: Partner with AI-driven marketers to craft tailored, high-impact strategies for your assets.
- **Asset Creation**: Collaborate with AI designers and copywriters to conceptualize and mint unique Stellar assets.
- **Execution**: Rely on the Orchestrator to break down tasks, assign them to specialized agents, and track progress in real-time for seamless execution.

===============================

## 🔗 Dependencies / Limitations<a name="dependencies--limitations"></a>

### Dependencies

- **Stellar Blockchain SDK**: Essential for seamless interaction with the Stellar network.
- **Data Sources**: Reliance on external APIs for on-chain metrics, Twitter sentiment analysis, and other critical data.
- **AI Frameworks**: Utilization of advanced tools for natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to power AI agents.
Limitations
- **Data Availability**: Performance is constrained by the quality and accessibility of external data sources.
- **Scalability**: Potential challenges in handling large-scale asset creation and management.
- **AI Accuracy**: Effectiveness of AI agents is dependent on the quality of training data and the sophistication of underlying algorithms.


## 🚀 Future Scope <a name="future-scope"></a>

### 🚀 Vision

- StellarAgent envisions a future where blockchain asset creation and management are seamless, intuitive, and accessible to everyone. - By combining the power of AI with the efficiency of the Stellar Blockchain, we aim to empower users to bring their ideas to life with minimal friction.

### 🎯 Mission

- Our mission is to simplify the complexities of blockchain technology and democratize asset creation.
- Through a suite of AI-powered tools, we provide users with the resources they need to:

- **Analyze**: Gain actionable insights from on-chain data and market trends.
- **Create**: Design and mint unique assets with the help of AI-driven tools.
- **Promote**: Develop and execute effective marketing strategies tailored to their goals.
- **Execute**: Streamline workflows with AI agents that handle tasks efficiently and transparently.

=======================================

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- Next.js
- Stellar SDK

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AReid987/stellarAgent.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
   cd stellarAgent/stellarAgentRepo
```

3. Install dependencies:

<!-- TODO: Install script -->

=======================================

## ⚠️ Consequences

<!-- TODO: Outline potential impacts of not addressing the problem. -->
<!-- - TODO: highlight the risks and costs associated with inaction, including financial losses, wasted time, reduced productivity, and diminished competitive advantage. -->

### Key Impacts

- **Opportunity Cost**: Failure to resolve the issue could lead to significant monetary losses due to inefficiencies or missed opportunities.
- **Time Wastage**: Without a solution, valuable time will be spent on manual processes or troubleshooting, slowing down operations.
- **Productivity Decline**: Unresolved problems often result in reduced efficiency and output, affecting overall asset performance.
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: Competitors who adopt better solutions may gain an edge, leaving your assets struggling to keep up.
- **Reputation Damage**: Persistent issues can harm your brand’s reputation, leading to a loss of customer trust and loyalty.

### Why It Matters

- Understanding these consequences is critical for prioritizing the problem and justifying the need for a solution.
- By addressing the issue proactively, the creator can avoid these negative outcomes and position oneself for long-term success.
