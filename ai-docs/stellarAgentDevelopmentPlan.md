## 👨‍💻 App Development Plan

---

### **🔭 I. Project Overview**

#### 🪪 App name

- **Stellar****Agent**

#### 🏷️ Tagline

- Agents for the Stellar blockchain

#### 🥅 Goals

- Provide a user-friendly interface

- Enable humans to collaborate with AI Agents

- Implement human-in-the-loop control

- Deploy Agents for:

  - Managing lobstr.co wallets

  - Creating and managing custom assets

  - Performing various actions on the Stellar blockchain

- Autonomous Wallet Management with AI Agents for the Stellar blockchain

#### 🎯 Target audience

- A small group of specific Individuals seeking to leverage the benefits of the Stellar blockchain with the support of AI-powered agents

#### 💰 Unique value proposition

- StellarAgent's AI Agents enable users to efficiently manage their wallets and assets, while providing a secure and compliant environment for transactions and interactions on the Stellar blockchain

---

### **II. Core Functionality**

#### **👨🏾‍💼 AI Agent Management**

- Create and manage multiple AI Agents, each with its own set of permissions and capabilities.

- Agents can create and manage wallets, assets, and perform transactions on the Stellar blockchain.

#### **💶 Wallet Management**

- Automated creation, login, transaction monitoring, and wallet management within Lobstr.co

- Agents can create new wallets on Lobstr.co if necessary.

- Agents can manage existing wallets, including sending and receiving funding transactions

- Transaction history and analytics.

#### **🖼️** **Asset Creation & Management**

- Integrate with Stellar SDK to communicate with Stellar Blockchain

#### **Develop a user-friendly interface**

- Create a simple and intuitive interface for creating and managing custom assets

#### **Implement asset validation and verification**

- Ensure that created assets comply with Stellar network rules and regulations

- Agents autonomously handle creation, issuance, and management of custom Stellar assets

- Agents can configure asset properties, such as name, description, and supply.

- Agents autonomously perform actions like sending/receiving lumens (XLM), trading custom assets, and interacting with Stellar dApps

- Real-time updates and notifications for users.

#### **Manage existing wallets and assets**

- Implement wallet and asset management functionalities, including transaction history, balance tracking, and asset validation

#### **Perform transactions and other actions**

- Develop tools to give agents a transaction engine that can execute various actions on the Stellar blockchain, such as sending and receiving assets, claiming assets, and voting

#### **🔁** **Human-in-the-Loop Collaboration**

- Users can collaborate with Agents to perform actions, such as creating new assets or sending transactions.

- User interface design for collaboration between humans and AI agents.

#### **User** **Interface**

- Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface:

  - Utilize modern front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion) to create a visually appealing and responsive interface

  - Provide real-time updates:

    - Implement WebSockets or Server-Sent Events to push real-time updates to users Collaboration modes:

#### **Semi-autonomous**

- Agents make decisions and execute actions without user input

#### **Manual override**

- Users have full control over wallet and asset management, with Agents providing supportive analytics and insights

#### **Fully autonomous**

- Agents provide recommendations, and users can choose to approve or reject actions

#### **Feedback mechanisms**

- Implement feedback mechanisms: Develop a rating system, surveys, or feedback forms to collect user input and improve Agent performance

#### **Agent action monitoring**

- Users can review and approve or reject Agent-proposed actions.

- approval/rejection system

- manual override

- user feedback mechanisms to improve Agent performance

- Users can collaborate with Agents by setting parameters and approving actions.

#### **Different collaboration modes**

- fully autonomous

- semi-autonomous

- manual override

- Real-time updates and notifications on ongoing processes.

#### 4.⚡  **Real-time Updates**

- Users receive real-time updates on the status of each action, including successes, failures, and errors.

#### **Implement push notifications**

- Utilize push notification services (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging, OneSignal) to notify users of important events

#### **Use email or in-app notifications**

- Send emails or in-app notifications to keep users informed about transactions, asset updates, and other relevant events

#### **Integrations**

- Integrate with Telegram or create Telegram Bot to provide users the option of receiving Telegram updates and participation in Human in the Loop

### **III. Agent Functionality**

#### 🦾 Agent capabilities

- Create new wallets if necessary

  - Implement Agent with functionality for browser control of lobstr.co API

  - Create new wallets, and ensure proper security measures (e.g., 2-factor authentication, encryption)

- Autonomously create and manage custom assets on the Stellar blockchain

  - Develop a user-friendly interface for creating and managing custom assets

  - ensure compliance with Stellar network rules

#### **Manage existing wallets and assets**

- Implement wallet and asset management functionalities, including transaction history, balance tracking, and asset validation

#### **Perform transactions and other actions**

- Develop tools to give agents a transaction engine that can execute various actions on the Stellar blockchain, such as sending and receiving assets, claiming assets, and voting

- Decision-making process for agents, including rules, logic, and improvement over time using Agentic Systems.

#### 🤔 Agent decision-making process

#### **Define rules and logic for Agent decision-making**

- Develop a decision-making framework that takes into account factors such as market trends, user preferences, and risk tolerance

#### **Integrate Agentic Systems**

- Utilize Agentic Systems (e.g., Agent E, AG2) to improve Agent performance and adapt to changing market conditions

- Integrate machine learning algorithms to improve Agent performance over time

### **IV. Development Roadmap**

- Prioritizing features and functionalities.

- Creating a development roadmap with milestones and deadlines.

- Establishing testing and quality assurance processes.

### **V. User Onboarding and Support**

- Developing a user-friendly onboarding process.

- Providing multilingual support.

- Establishing multiple support channels.

#### 🗣️ Feedback mechanisms

#### **Implement feedback mechanisms**

- Develop a rating system, surveys, or feedback forms to collect user input and improve Agent performance

#### **Transaction history**

- Maintain a transaction history: Develop a database to store transaction history, and provide users with access to this information

- Allow users to view and analyze transaction history: Implement data visualization tools (e.g., charts, graphs) to help users understand their transaction history
